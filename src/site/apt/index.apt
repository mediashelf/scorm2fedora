    {{{http://www.github.com/mediashelf/scorm2fedora}scorm2fedora}} is a service 
that accepts SCORM packages, and in turn, deposits them in a Fedora repository.

    scorm2fedora is distributed as both a Java library (jar) and web application 
(war). The latter merely wraps the former and provides a REST endpoint.

    scorm2fedora has been tested with Fedora 3.3 and the trunk build of the
upcoming Fedora 3.4 release (as of 2010-05-20).
